    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <div class="pgraphs">
      <p>
        Some people may disagree with many of the facts made in this paper. Some
        may say that the ancient Greeks didn’t care all that much about
        athleticism, or how sports have not evolved very much. There may even be
        relevant information that can debunk the claims made in this paper. For
        instance, there may be very compelling evidence that the ancient Greeks
        didn’t care very much for athleticism. It is very easy to claim that
        because the ancient world is so old many tablets or artifacts could have
        been destroyed that state how unimportant athleticism was to the ancient
        world.
      </p>

        It is also very easy to claim that sports have not evolved much over
        time. Many of the events in the ancient Olympics are relatively the same
        as the ones in the modern Olympics. For example, it is very hard for
        running events to change over time. While this all may be true, these
        events have had many rule changes that show that the human race has
        evolved not only in sports but also as a race as a whole. The human race
        has evolved over hundreds of years and has shown many clear distinctions
        between the ancient world and the modern world.
      </p>
      <p>
        While there are still many discrepancies between the two eras, there are
        also many parallels. The human race is still just as competitive and
        still cares about athleticism, just like the ancient humans once were.
        Humans have become more humane over time, mainly by making sports events
        safer for athletes. Overall, the modern era of athletics and sports has
        definitely changed since the era of ancient Greece, but the will and
        competitiveness have not budged.
