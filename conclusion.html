          Some people may disagree with many of the facts made in this paper.
          Some may say that the ancient Greeks didn’t care all that much about
          athleticism, or how sports have not evolved very much. There may even
          be relevant information that can debunk the claims made in this paper.
          For instance, there may be very compelling evidence that the ancient
          Greeks didn’t care very much for athleticism. It is very easy to claim
          that because the ancient world is so old many tablets or artifacts
          could have been destroyed that state how unimportant athleticism was
          to the ancient world.

          It is also very easy to claim that sports have not evolved much over
          time. Many of the events in the ancient Olympics are relatively the
          same as the ones in the modern Olympics. For example, it is very hard
          for running events to change over time. While this all may be true,
          these events have had many rule changes that show that the human race
          has evolved not only in sports but also as a race as a whole. The
          human race has evolved over hundreds of years and has shown many clear
          distinctions between the ancient world and the modern world.

          While there are still many discrepancies between the two eras, there
          are also many parallels. The human race is still just as competitive
          and still cares about athleticism, just like the ancient humans once
          were. Humans have become more humane over time, mainly by making
          sports events safer for athletes. Overall, the modern era of athletics
          and sports has definitely changed since the era of ancient Greece, but
          the will and competitiveness have not budged.
