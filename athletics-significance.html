    <h2>The Significance of Athleticism in ancient Greece</h2>
    <p>
      Sports and athletics were of utmost importance to many of the ancient
      Greek people. While to some ancient Greek people, sports may not have been
      as important, to others it was just as important as glory. On some
      occasions, formal games were held at events: “honor funerals, celebrate
      military victories, mark the foundations of cities, and to pay homage to
      gods and heroes” (Poliakoff). In the poem, the Odyssey, having a proper
      funeral was shown to be important to the ancient Greeks. When Odysseus
      visited the underworld, one of his dead shipmates requested a proper
      burial. After their meeting, Odysseus did exactly what was requested of
      him. This shows just how important burials must have been for the ancient
      Greek people. For these athletic games to be held at funerals shows just
      how big of a role the athletic games must have been in their lives.
      Another example of how important athleticism is can be found in the
      military. For instance, in ancient Sparta, whenever the Spartan soldiers
      were low in confidence, their king gave them an opportunity to show their
      athleticism: “When the Spartan king Agesilaus wanted to hearten his
      troops, he stripped and exhibited naked captured soldiers of the enemy
      Persian forces in order to show how unathletic they were in comparison to
      Greek men and how easily they would fall in battle” (Poliakoff). This
      helps illustrate just how important athleticism was to some people in
      ancient Greece. Not only does this show how important athleticism was to
      the morale of the soldiers, but it also shows how they were able to use
      this to gain dominance over their opponents. This can still be held
      somewhat true in the modern world. Modern countries can sometimes
      demonstrate the athleticism of their militaries through physical tests.
      Some common tests include push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups, and long-distance
      runs. Other than physical tests, the modern world does not usually use
      athleticism to demonstrate power. Some may argue that military weapon
      testing can be used to demonstrate power, but that does not show the
      capabilities of the physical abilities of a country's power.
