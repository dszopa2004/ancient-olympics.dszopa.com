    <h2>The Significance of the Ancient Olympics in Ancient Greece</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Since the start of the human race, people have been competitive and
        athletic. As time went on, humans had less of a reliance on
        competitiveness and athleticism for survival. Over hundreds of years,
        humans can use these attributes for fun instead of survival. While being
        competitive is a trait that people don’t really need for survival
        anymore, it is still important in other aspects of life. For example,
        people need to be competitive in the workforce in order to succeed.
        Athleticism is not necessarily in the same boat as competitiveness,
        however. In our modern era, athleticism can be used more for leisure.
        The same could be said for competitiveness, but athleticism doesn’t play
        as much of a role in the day-to-day life of a regular person unless they
        are an athlete. In ancient Greece, however, competitiveness and
        athleticism were a major part of daily life. For both men and women,
        participating in competitive sports was an important part of life,
        especially because of the significance of glory in the ancient Greek
        era. The ancient Olympics allowed these athletes to earn this highly
        sought-after glory and pride. While this is very similar to the modern
        Olympics, the only women who could compete had to be non-married, Greek
        women were able to participate in these ancient Olympics. Modern Olympic
        events also have many more rules and regulations, while the ancient
        Olympic events had barely any rules or regulations. Analyzing the
        differences between the ancient and modern Olympics sheds light on the
        evolution of competitiveness and athleticism in the human race. Not only
        do the differences reflect the significance of these traits in the
        ancient and modern eras, but they also display the parallels between the
        culture of modern humans and ancient ones. In this article, I will
        convey what the ancient Olympics were and how men and women each played
        a role in them, the diets of the athletes, the variety and significance
        of the sports these athletes competed in, and how sports have evolved
        throughout time to the modern era.

        To begin, it is important to note the origin of the word “athlete.”
        According to the Penn Museum, the word could have been derived from two
        other Greek words: “In fact, the word athlete is an ancient Greek word
        that means ‘one who competes for a prize’ and was related to two other
        Greek words, athlos meaning’"contest’ and athlon meaning ‘prize’”
        (Penn). This shows how the definition of an athlete has not changed much
        between the ancient Greek world and the modern world. An athlete in
        modern terms is still a person who competes for a prize. One small
        difference between the ancient definition and the modern one is that the
        modern definition of an athlete includes that an athlete must perform
        some sort of physical activity. While this is not directly stated in the
        ancient definition of the word, it is implied by the activities that the
        ancient people performed.
