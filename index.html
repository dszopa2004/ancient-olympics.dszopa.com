    <h1>The Significance of Athleticism in Ancient Greece</h1>
    <p>
      Since the start of the human race, people have been competitive and
      athletic. As time went on, humans had less of a reliance on
      competitiveness and athleticism for survival. Over hundreds of years,
      humans can use these attributes for fun instead of survival. While being
      competitive is a trait that people don’t really need for survival anymore,
      it is still important in other aspects of life. For example, people need
      to be competitive in the workforce in order to succeed. Athleticism is not
      necessarily in the same boat as competitiveness, however. In our modern
      era, athleticism can be used more for leisure. The same could be said for
      competitiveness, but athleticism doesn’t play as much of a role in the
      day-to-day life of a regular person unless they are an athlete. In ancient
      Greece, however, competitiveness and athleticism were a major part of
      daily life. For both men and women, participating in competitive sports
      was an important part of life, especially because of the significance of
      glory in the ancient Greek era. The ancient Olympics allowed these
      athletes to earn this highly sought-after glory and pride. While this is
      very similar to the modern Olympics, the only women who could compete had
      to be non-married, Greek women were able to participate in these ancient
      Olympics. Modern Olympic events also have many more rules and regulations,
      while the ancient Olympic events had barely any rules or regulations.
      Analyzing the differences between the ancient and modern Olympics sheds
      light on the evolution of competitiveness and athleticism in the human
      race. Not only do the differences reflect the significance of these traits
      in the ancient and modern eras, but they also display the parallels
      between the culture of modern humans and ancient ones. In this article, I
      will convey what the ancient Olympics were and how men and women each
      played a role in them, the diets of the athletes, the variety and
      significance of the sports these athletes competed in, and how sports have
      evolved throughout time to the modern era.
