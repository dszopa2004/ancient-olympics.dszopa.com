    <h2>The Evolution of Sports</h2>
    <p>
      This leads to how sports have evolved over time. Many sports in the
      ancient Greek world involved little to no accessories. For instance, there
      was no ball that the athletes would use. Many of the events forced the
      ancient athletes to use their bodies to their fullest potential. One
      event, however, used animals in order to compete. In the chariot racing
      event, athletes would ride a chariot with a set number of horses: “There
      were both 2-horse chariot and 4-horse chariot races, with separate races
      for chariots drawn by foals. Another race was between carts drawn by a
      team of 2 mules. The course was 12 laps around the stadium track (9
      miles)” (Ancient Sports). This is an example that shows that there was one
      event in the ancient Olympics where athletes used some sort of accessory
      in an event. In an event like this, an athlete demonstrates their skill
      more than their physical ability, which makes it similar to a modern event
      like basketball. Both chariot racing and basketball need some sort of
      physical ability, but both sports are more focused on the ability of the
      athlete to use the designated accessory. Another distinction between
      modern and ancient Olympics is the rules of certain events. For instance,
      pankration would never be allowed in the modern Olympics because of how
      brutal and inhumane of a sport it was. In the ancient world, it was not
      seen as inhumane, which shows just how much the human race has evolved as
      a whole. People in the modern era are able to recognize when something is
      inhumane and stop it.
