    <h2>The Evolution of Sports</h2>

        <p class="text">
          This leads to how sports have evolved over time. Many sports in the
          ancient Greek world involved little to no accessories. For instance,
          there was no ball that the athletes would use. Many of the events
          forced the ancient athletes to use their bodies to their fullest
          potential. One event, however, used animals in order to compete. In
          the chariot racing event, athletes would ride a chariot with a set
          number of horses: “There were both 2-horse chariot and 4-horse chariot
          races, with separate races for chariots drawn by foals. Another race
          was between carts drawn by a team of 2 mules. The course was 12 laps
          around the stadium track (9 miles)” (Ancient Sports).

          This is an example that shows that there was one event in the ancient
          Olympics where athletes used some sort of accessory in an event. In an
          event like this, an athlete demonstrates their skill more than their
          physical ability, which makes it similar to a modern event like
          basketball. Both chariot racing and basketball need some sort of
          physical ability, but both sports are more focused on the ability of
          the athlete to use the designated accessory.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Another distinction between modern and ancient Olympics is the rules
          of certain events. For instance, pankration would never be allowed in
          the modern Olympics because of how brutal and inhumane of a sport it
          was. In the ancient world, it was not seen as inhumane, which shows
          just how much the human race has evolved as a whole. People in the
          modern era are able to recognize when something is inhumane and stop
          it.
