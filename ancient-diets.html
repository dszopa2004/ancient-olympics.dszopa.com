    <h1>The Diets of Ancient Athletes</h1>
    <p>
      Another important topic to discuss is the diets of the ancient Greek
      athletes. The diet of an athlete is quite potentially the most important
      part of being an athlete, at least in the modern era. This makes it
      important to discuss the ideology of nutrition in the ancient world.
      According to Jan Bažant, the ancient Greek athletes were absolute
      gluttons: “As long as the 5th century B.C. the Greek athlete was notorious
      for being a slave to his jaw and his belly” (Bažant). This is important to
      note, as it shows that these athletes probably ate much more than they
      should have. It is also important to know the diets of the average ancient
      Greek person. Because Greece has direct access to the sea, their diet
      generally consisted of seafood (Jensen). This can be shown by marine life
      on pottery, such as squid and octopi on pots (Jensen). This shows that
      even while the athletes were gluttons, they were still probably eating
      high-protein meals. However, the fact that the ancient athletes were
      considered to be “slaves to their jaws and their bellies” (Bažant) shows
      how little the people back then understood about nutrition. According to
      Jan Bažant, the diets of the ancient Greeks did not line up with The
      American Association for Health, Physical Education and Recreation:
      “Ancient Greek sportsmen really did not comply with the principles
      propagated by The American Association for Health, Physical Education and
      Recreation” (Bažant). This proves even further that the ancient Greeks had
      no clue what they were doing in regard to their diets. In contrast, the
      study of nutrition has been studied very well in the modern era. Athletes
      know what they should and shouldn’t eat. Many athletes these days eat
      high-protein, whole foods. The way that muscles grow has been extensively
      researched, and scientists have concluded that eating high-protein foods
      is what contributes to muscle growth. Athletes have realized that having
      stronger muscles will contribute to better performance in whichever sport
      they are competing in. This shows the biggest disparity between the diets
      of ancient and modern athletes. The ancient Greek athletes probably were
      not able to maximize the amount of growth they could have had because of
      their lack of knowledge of nutrition.
