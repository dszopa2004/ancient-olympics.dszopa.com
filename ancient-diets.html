    <h2>The Diets of Ancient Athletes</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Another important topic to discuss is the diets of the ancient Greek
        athletes. The diet of an athlete is quite potentially the most important
        part of being an athlete, at least in the modern era. This makes it
        important to discuss the ideology of nutrition in the ancient world.
        According to Jan Bažant, the ancient Greek athletes were absolute
        gluttons: “As long as the 5th century B.C. the Greek athlete was
        notorious for being a slave to his jaw and his belly” (Bažant). This is
        important to note, as it shows that these athletes probably ate much
        more than they should have. It is also important to know the diets of
        the average ancient Greek person. Because Greece has direct access to
        the sea, their diet generally consisted of seafood (Jensen). This can be
        shown by marine life on pottery, such as squid and octopi on pots
        (Jensen). This shows that even while the athletes were gluttons, they
        were still probably eating high-protein meals. However, the fact that
        the ancient athletes were considered to be “slaves to their jaws and
        their bellies” (Bažant) shows how little the people back then understood
        about nutrition. According to Jan Bažant, the diets of the ancient
        Greeks did not line up with The American Association for Health,
        Physical Education and Recreation: “Ancient Greek sportsmen really did
        not comply with the principles propagated by The American Association
        for Health, Physical Education and Recreation” (Bažant). This proves
        even further that the ancient Greeks had no clue what they were doing in
        regard to their diets. In contrast, the study of nutrition has been
        studied very well in the modern era. Athletes know what they should and
        shouldn’t eat. Many athletes these days eat high-protein, whole foods.
        The way that muscles grow has been extensively researched, and
        scientists have concluded that eating high-protein foods is what
        contributes to muscle growth. Athletes have realized that having
        stronger muscles will contribute to better performance in whichever
        sport they are competing in. This shows the biggest disparity between
        the diets of ancient and modern athletes. The ancient Greek athletes
        probably were not able to maximize the amount of growth they could have
        had because of their lack of knowledge of nutrition.
