    <h2>Ancient Olympic Events</h2>

          There were a plethora of events in the ancient Olympics. The events
          included “boxing, equestrian events, pankration, pentathlon, running,
          and wrestling” (<i>Ancient Sports</i>). Some of these events also had
          sub-events. For instance, the equestrian events consisted of chariot
          racing and riding (<i>Ancient Sports</i>). The pentathlon consisted of
          discus, javelin, jump, running, and wrestling (<i>Ancient Sports</i>).
          This shows just how many different events there were that the ancient
          athletes could participate in.

          Of these sports, pankration is the event that sticks out the most.
          This event would not be allowed in the modern Olympics under any
          circumstances. This event allowed the use of any martial arts
          techniques, but the only rules were ones that restricted “biting and
          gouging an opponent’s eyes nose or mouth with fingers” (Nenova). This
          sport would be considered very cruel in the modern era, and it
          wouldn’t even be considered an event. According to Stella Nenova, “its
          name derives from the ancient Greek words pan (all) and kratos
          (strength, might, power) and literally means ‘all of the might’”
          (Nenova). This event was “introduced as a sporting event in the 33rd
          Olympic Games where it joined boxing and wrestling in a category
          called ‘heavy events’” (Nenova).

          There is another sport that is not currently in the modern Olympics.
          In this event, athletes would run “two to four stade” (<i
            >Ancient Sports</i
          >) in their armor, which weighed “50-60lbs” (<i>Ancient Sports</i>),
          with each stade being the length of the arena. While running is still
          an event, there is certainly no event where athletes run with weight
          holding them down. However, this is still a sport in which some
          athletes participate. This sport is called “rucking”, where a person
          walks or runs with a weighted vest or backpack.
