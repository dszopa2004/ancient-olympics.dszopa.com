    <h2>Ancient Olympic Events</h2>
    <div class="pgraphs">
      <p>
        There were a plethora of events in the ancient Olympics. The events
        included “boxing, equestrian events, pankration, pentathlon, running,
        and wrestling” (Ancient Sports). Some of these events also had
        sub-events. For instance, the equestrian events consisted of chariot
        racing and riding (Ancient Sports). The pentathlon consisted of discus,
        javelin, jump, running, and wrestling (Ancient Sports). This shows just
        how many different events there were that the ancient athletes could
        participate in. Of these sports, pankration is the event that sticks out
        the most. This event would not be allowed in the modern Olympics under
        any circumstances. This event allowed the use of any martial arts
        techniques, but the only rules were ones that restricted “biting and
        gouging an opponent’s eyes nose or mouth with fingers” (Nenova). This
        sport would be considered very cruel in the modern era, and it wouldn’t
        even be considered an event. According to Stella Nenova, “its name
        derives from the ancient Greek words pan (all) and kratos (strength,
        might, power) and literally means ‘all of the might’” (Nenova). This
        event was “introduced as a sporting event in the 33rd Olympic Games
        where it joined boxing and wrestling in a category called ‘heavy
        events’” (Nenova). There is another sport that is not currently in the
        modern Olympics. In this event, athletes would run “two to four stade”
        (Ancient Sports) in their armor, which weighed “50-60lbs” (Ancient
        Sports), with each stade being the length of the arena. While running is
        still an event, there is certainly no event where athletes run with
        weight holding them down. However, this is still a sport in which some
        athletes participate. This sport is called “rucking”, where a person
        walks or runs with a weighted vest or backpack.
