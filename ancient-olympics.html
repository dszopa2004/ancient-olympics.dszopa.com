    <h2>What Were the Ancient Olympics?</h2>

          The ancient Olympics were a place where ancient Greek athletes could
          compete for glory and for fame. There are numerous examples to show
          how the ancient Greeks practically lived for glory. One of the most
          clear examples of this can be seen in Homer’s Odyssey. In the epic,
          Odysseus and his crewmates get stuck inside a cave with Polyphemus, a
          giant cyclops. Odysseus is able to outsmart Polyphemus by calling
          himself “Nobody”. He blinds Polyphemus by getting him very drunk so
          that he would fall asleep, which gave Odysseus enough time to stab his
          eye. As Odysseus and his crew are leaving the island, Odysseus reveals
          to Polyphemus his real name to make sure that he knows who defeated
          him. This shows just how much the ancient Greeks cared about glory.
          Odysseus would have been able to get away with injuring the son of a
          god, but he had to ensure that Polyphemus knew who defeated him.

          The ancient Greeks were also able to bring fame to their city-states.
          According to Nigel B. Crowther, the athletes who were victorious were
          given prizes and prestige to their city: “Ancient cities rewarded well
          athletes who were victorious in the games and thereby brought prestige
          to the city…” (Crowther). This shows how ancient Greek athletes not
          only competed for themselves but also for their cities. This also
          shows how athletes were appreciated in the ancient world. If these
          athletes were not appreciated and welcomed, they would certainly not
          be rewarded for their victories. The ancient Olympics were hosted in
          many cities, and each city-state held the competitions in honor of
          certain gods. According to Sean and Colette Hemingway, the ancient
          Olympics were hosted in city-states such as “Delphi, Nemea, and
          Isthmia” (Hemingway). Each of these city-states honored different
          gods. For example, “the Pythian games at Delphi honored Apollo”
          (Hemingway), and “the games at Nemea honored Zeus” (Hemingway). This
          shows how the ancient Olympics may have varied from city to city.
