    <h2>What Were the Ancient Olympics?</h2>
    <p>
      The ancient Olympics were a place where ancient Greek athletes could
      compete for glory and for fame. There are numerous examples to show how
      the ancient Greeks practically lived for glory. One of the most clear
      examples of this can be seen in Homer’s Odyssey. In the epic, Odysseus and
      his crewmates get stuck inside a cave with Polyphemus, a giant cyclops.
      Odysseus is able to outsmart by calling himself “Nobody” and blind
      Polyphemus and by getting him very drunk. As Odysseus and his crew are
      leaving the island, Odysseus yells for Polyphemus his name in order to
      make sure that Polyphemus knows who defeated him. This shows just how much
      the ancient Greeks cared about glory. Odysseus would have been able to get
      away with injuring the son of a god, but he had to ensure that Polyphemus
      knew who defeated him. The ancient Greeks were also able to bring fame to
      their city-states. According to Nigel B. Crowther, the athletes who were
      victorious were given prizes and prestige to their city: “Ancient cities
      rewarded well athletes who were victorious in the games and thereby
      brought prestige to the city…” (Crowther). This shows how ancient Greek
      athletes not only competed for themselves but also for their cities. This
      also shows how athletes were appreciated in the ancient world. If these
      athletes were not appreciated and welcomed, they would certainly not be
      rewarded for their victories. The ancient Olympics were hosted in many
      cities, and each city-state held the competitions in honor of certain
      gods. According to Sean and Colette Hemingway, the ancient Olympics were
      hosted in city-states such as “Delphi, Nemea, and Isthmia” (Hemingway).
      Each of these city-states honored different gods. For example, “the
      Pythian games at Delphi honored Apollo” (Hemingway), and “the games at
      Nemea honored Zeus” (Hemingway). This shows how the ancient Olympics may
      have varied from city to city.
