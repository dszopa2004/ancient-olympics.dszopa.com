    <h2>Who Could Participate in the Ancient Olympics?</h2>

          Men were not the only people who could compete in the ancient
          Olympics. Women were able to participate in these events as well: “The
          games young, unmarried women competed in were celebrated for Hera”
          (Hemingway). This shows that women even had a god that they sponsored
          during their Olympics. There is even literature that depicts women
          participating in sports: “Of all the well-known female characters in
          the Iliad and the Odyssey only Nausicaa, the young virgin daughter of
          King Alcinous and Queen Arete, indulged in playful games and
          sport-like activities” (Spears). One important thing to note is that
          “the language of the poem is explicit in its use of words to
          distinguish play from sport” (Spears). While the language in the poem
          does not explicitly state that the woman is participating in sports,
          she is still depicted as playing in sport-like activities.

          Another way that women are depicted in athletics is through art.
          According to Betty Spears, there are vases and statuettes that “show a
          young girl running” (Spears). This is very interesting because
          normally only men are depicted to be doing some sort of athletic
          activity such as hunting. As a result, the art is a very strong hint
          that points towards the ability of women to participate in the ancient
          Olympics. It is also very surprising that young, unmarried women were
          allowed to compete in these events. Up until recent history, women
          were not seen as athletes: “In the United States neither
          intercollegiate championships nor athletic scholarships for women
          existed in 1966” (Spears). This illustrates how the ancient Greek
          society can be seen as progressive. Although women in ancient Greece
          were generally seen as property, they were still offered an
          opportunity to be seen as an athlete, according to the ancient Greek
          definition of an athlete. However, this is very different from how
          modern women are able to participate in the Olympics. In the modern
          era, women, married or unmarried, are able to compete in any event
          that they may qualify for in the modern Olympics.
