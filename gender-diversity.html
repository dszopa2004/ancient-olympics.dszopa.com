        Men were not the only people who could compete in the ancient Olympics.
        Women were able to participate in these events as well: “The games
        young, unmarried women competed in were celebrated for Hera”
        (Hemingway). This shows that women even had a god that they sponsored
        during their Olympics. There is even literature that depicts women
        participating in sports: “Of all the well-known female characters in the
        Iliad and the Odyssey only Nausicaa, the young virgin daughter of King
        Alcinous and Queen Arete, indulged in playful games and sport-like
        activities” (Spears). One important thing to note is that “the language
        of the poem is explicit in its use of words to distinguish play from
        sport” (Spears). While the language in the poem does not explicitly
        state that the woman is participating in sports, she is still depicted
        as playing in sport-like activities. Another way that women are depicted
        in athletics is through art. According to Betty Spears, there are vases
        and statuettes that “show a young girl running” (Spears). This is very
        interesting because normally only men are depicted to be doing some sort
        of athletic activity such as hunting. As a result, the art is a very
        strong hint that points towards the ability of women to participate in
        the ancient Olympics. It is also very surprising that young, unmarried
        women were allowed to compete in these events. Up until recent history,
        women were not seen as athletes: “In the United States neither
        intercollegiate championships nor athletic scholarships for women
        existed in 1966” (Spears). This illustrates how the ancient Greek
        society can be seen as progressive. Although women in ancient Greece
        were generally seen as property, they were still offered an opportunity
        to be seen as an athlete, according to the ancient Greek definition of
        an athlete. However, this is very different from how modern women are
        able to participate in the Olympics. In the modern era, women, married
        or unmarried, are able to compete in any event that they may qualify for
        in the modern Olympics.
